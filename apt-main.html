						<p>We all know that dieting and exercise can be a challenge in the beginning. After a little commitment it becomes easier and when you start to see and feel the benefits, it becomes a state of mind. My job is to help you discover your area of focus and then guide you through the processes and techniques for you to achieve your personal goals.</p><br><br><p>I coach a wide range of clients who have a variety of different ambitions. I provide something for everyone. Whether you are looking to improve your flexibility, increase your maximum lift, make a healthy dietary adjustment or even simply just gain some advice on technique or motivation. I'm always available for a chat and I invite you to send me a message with the goals you have in mind!</p>

							<h1>Support</h1>
							<h4>We rise by lifting others</h4>
							<p>I believe that successful personal training boils down to a few simple steps. When getting started on a new plan, it can be intimidating with the saturation of information online, conflicting opinions and seemingly endless sources.<br><br>I will closely engage with you to achieve your specific outcomes, while explaining theory behind each practice. Health and fitness misinformation can be a minefield, I'm here to support you through a learning-based process.</p>
						</div>
						<div>
							<img src="hands2.png" alt="illustration of andrea's hands">
							<h1>Guidance</h1>
							<h4>Confidence through guidance</h4>
							<p>With the right guidance comes long term benefits and the correct process to achieve short term goals. Immediate gratification is not the same as choosing to make beneficial changes to your lifestyle. Progress is a marathon rather than a sprint. <br><br> Together we will establish what you wish to achieve, before giving you the information and resources to help you maintain steady progress without burning out or getting injured.</p>

							<h1>Motivation</h1>
							<h4>Optimism = success</h4>
							<p>Sometimes everyone needs a kick up the butt! Stale old plans, repetitive diets and not recognising progress are all ingredients for plateau soup. Motivation can be the hardest thing of all in the spectrum of physical and mental wellbeing, I'm here to provide constant, gentle pressure and variety in your routine.<br><br>Remember, pressure makes diamonds and variety is the spice of life. Let's make some spicy diamond soup, together.</p>

					<h1>Flexibility</h1>
					<h4>Not just trendy to be bendy, Wendy!</h4>
					<p>Flexibility is fundamental to utilising a healthy body. You might have stacks of muscle, but with poor flexibility you won't be able to do much with it! A few simple changes in your routine, proper stretching and perfect technique will make all the difference. You'll be bending over backwards in no time!</p><button class="frmbtn">My flexi-plan</button>
				</div>
				<div class="strength">
					<h1>Strength</h1>
					<h4>HEY! What's strong with you?</h4>
					<p>The most important step in stength training is to record your progress. To avoid that steaming bowl of plateau soup I construct personal, individual progress reports which show clear changes between sessions. Once you see the stats start to improve you will be smashing your goals. And if the bar ain't bending... you're pretending. </p><button class="frmbtn">To the gun show</button>

					<h1>Diet Plans</h1>
					<h4>It all starts in the kitchen...</h4>
					<p>A healthy change in diet is the first step in looking and feeling better. Weight loss isn't only reason to make certain changes to what you consume. People can become discouraged when searching for new recipes and inspiration so I ensure all of my clients are presented with healthy, affordable and delicious meal plans on a weekly basis.<br><br> Nothing on the menu will challenge your cooking ability, although I do also have advanced meal ideas which will push your culinary creativity to a new level. I encourage balance and can cater to all dietary requirements without compromising on quality.</p>

					<h1>Training Plans</h1>
					<h4>...and ends in the gym!</h4>
					<p>Once you gain confidence in the kitchen you will be able to bring new and improved energy into the gym. While great diet is the foundation of a healthy mind and body, my unique training programs help you to push yourself physically beyond what you previously thought possible.<br><br> Static, repetitive motions aren't always going to keep you driven to hit the gym so I've drawn up dynamic routines which cater to a complete range of results. I will guide you through the detailed structure of a plan designed to meet your personal desired outcomes. Go big or go home! </p>

					<h2>Ms. E Elliot</h2>
					<h4>Podcaster</h4>
					<p><q>Andrea is an absolute tank! I couldn't get over the complete range of knowledge she had. She was very professional and unintrusive while applying enough pressure to ensure a hard training plan with excellent results. I've never been so flexible and my husband is thrilled!</q></p>

					<h2>Peter Ock</h2>
					<h4>Ski Instructor</h4>
					<p><q>I was skeptical about getting a trainer at first. I always thought of it as something that was expensive and that I could yeild the same results alone at home. I couldn't have been more wrong, since meeting Dre my standing vertical jump is over nine feet!</q></p>

					<h2>Prof. Large</h2>
					<h4>Breakdancer</h4>
					<p><q>I learnt so much just hanging out with Andrea and her passion shines through her intricate and challenging training plans. She helped my drop 60 lbs since I started with her. Bit annoying that I had to buy new trousers but my headspins don't put nearly as much strain on my neck now. </q></p>

						<h1>FAQ</h1>
					<button class="accordion">Will the fitness coaching be too difficult for a beginner?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p> No! Part of the information you’ll give me when you start is your current exercise habits. I will tailor the fitness coaching to your current level. For example, if you don’t currently do any regular exercise, we’ll start with adding some daily activity into your routine. This might be walking more regularly, taking the stairs instead of the lift at work etc. We start small, so you can establish a new habit, then build on it from there.</p>
					</div>
						<button class="accordion">What will we generally do in a session?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>Each session starts off with a brief discussion to ensure you are staying on track (diet, training alone, etc.) Since I handle most of that for you via email, it doesn’t cut into your session time. Every individual’s training sessions are different based upon their goals, but most programs consist of a light warm-up and stretching, 40-55 minutes of resistance training, followed by a cool down and stretching period. Depending on the individual’s goals, a cardio regimen may also be followed.</p>
					</div>
						<button class="accordion">What's included in your typical program?</button>
					<div class="panel">
					  <p>All our programs include an initial testing and evaluation, resistance training and cardiovascular training program design, a review of flexibility, and coaching to work through the process – ensuring your success. Councilling includes a complete nutrition program design, meal plans, grocery list, and our nutritional guide to help re-educate you on supportive eating to help you achieve your results.</p>
